Josan was flattered and their story starts.They became friends right away. They started talking and chatting everyday and before they knew it, they’re friendship developed into something more deeper.

  description: Bryan, being a guy who loves to eat, asked Josan out to dinner. After Josan accepted his invite, Bryan then picked her up. They’ve decided to eat in a simple fast food restaurant “Bon Chon”. Bryan just got back from the U.S. that time and he wasn’t aware that he doesn’t have cash in Philippine currency. So what seems to be a very typical first date turned out to be unexpected. Josan was the one who paid for their first date. It might seem like a bad impression on a first date, but Bryan was able to ask for more dates after to “make bawi” to Josan.

  description: Tagaytay was one of their favorite place to unwind and get away from the city. Bryan called a hotel in tagaytay to help him ask the big question. There were petals on the floor and candles were lit. Josan was getting a hint on where the night is going. Bryan instructed the staff, using petals, to make a heart with the words “will you marry me?”, inside it. On such a random time, he asked the most genuine question.
